# TypeDB Benchmark

Tools to run benchmarks for TypeDB.

## TypeDB Simulation

TypeDB Simulation is a library built to enable the creation of real-world simulations for TypeDB. TypeDB Simulation is generic, not bound to any one DBMS or any one use case. Besides running simulations, it can also be used to benchmark supported database systems and perform comparisons.

## TPCC

A Python-based framework of the TPC-C OLTP benchmark for NoSQL systems. The benchmark code was originally written by Brown University students for a graduate seminar course on NoSQL Systems.

## LDBC (v2)

Contains reference implementations of the LDBC Social Network Benchmark's Interactive v2 workload. The design and implementation of the workload are described in the TPCTC 2023 paper, "The LDBC Social Network Benchmark Interactive Workload v2: A Transactional Graph Query Benchmark with Deep Delete Operations" by PÃ¼roja et al.
